# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# notice loading order,  site, default data, user

# it is calling spree_multi_site/db/seed.rb to load db/default & db/firstshop 
# data folder is spree_abc/db, it is specified by SpreeMultiSite::Config.seed_dir 
ENV['AUTO_ACCEPT'] ='1'

SpreeMultiSite::Engine.load_seed #if defined?(SpreeMultiSite)
SpreeTheme::Engine.load_seed
# fake_orders/spree/*  are data related to orders, like address, order..
# for reasons time consume and useless to customer, system does not load those file while loading sample.
# it is only for test now.
