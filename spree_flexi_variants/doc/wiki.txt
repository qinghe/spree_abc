### Fine-grained view customizations

You can easily modify the way the **Ad Hoc Options** are displayed by creating partials based on the option type name.


### Simple Ad Hoc Options Example

Let's create an imaginary product called 'Spap'.  It has two option types - sizes and colors.  All the sizes alter the price, but none of the colors do.

Let's now use the admin app to create these ad-hoc options

### Administration

Refer to the [spree documentation](http://spreecommerce.com/documentation/overview) for the details on how to add option types and option values.

You'll create option types 'size' and 'colors', and add the associated option values.  The case to use this extension becomes more compelling as the number of options types/values grows.

With that said, you can only create 2 or 3 option values for each to see the effects, so create sizes S,M, and L and colors red, green, and blue.

Create a product 'Spap'.

From there, go into the *Ad Hoc Variant Option Types* tab on the bottom right.

Add both option types.  After adding each one, you'll be redirected to a screen that displays all the possible option values, along with a price field.

Give each a price (leave some of them 0.00 if you like).

Now go into the store and see the drop downs for the 'Spap'.

Notice how the price changes according to your selections.

Add the 'Spap' to the cart and look at the description.

Note that Ad Hoc Options can coexist with 'traditional' variants.

Also note that you can create a partial having the same name as the option type to override the display, possibly enabling **multiple option values** within an option type to be selected!

### Ad Hoc Variant Exclusions

You might have a small subset of unavailable option combinations.  This subset is called an *Ad Hoc Exclusion*.

### Ad Hoc Options Example using Exclusions

Let's create another product, called 'Gerfo', configured just like 'Spap'.

Just to make the example more complex, add a third option type, "gloss", with values "dull", "shiny", and "annoying".

Assume that color "blue" shouldn't be allowed with finish "annoying" (it doesn't matter what size).

Another illegal combination is size=small, color=green, and gloss="dull".

### Administration

Configure the ad hoc option types as in the first example, then click the "Ad Hoc Exclusions" link on the right.

Add the illegal combinations mentioned above, then go to the store and play with the drop-downs to see the effect.


### Simple Product Customizations Example
----------------------------------

Let's create a 'rope' product.  I only sell one type of rope, but I'll cut it any length.

### Administration

Inside the admin app, click 'Products', then click the *Customization Types* sub-menu item..

Create a new type called 'length_customization' with presentation 'Cut to length (inches)'.  Leave the description blank. Select the AmountTimesConstant calculator.

Once created, fill in the options for the calculator and the customization option row at the bottom and update.

Now create the rope product then click the *Customization Types* tab on the bottom right.

You'll see there are no customization types added to the product.

Click the 'Add Product Customization Type' link and select the length_customization to the product.

Now go to the store, select the rope, enter the desired length, and add to cart.

Note that customizations can be displayed in a custom fashion with partials, both at the 'customization' level, as well as the 'customizable option' level.

### Other Customizations
------------------------

There are a couple other calculators provided (you can always add your own).  See the product_area calucator for a customization that has more than one customizable option.

There is also an 'engraving' calculator.

Product Pricing Display Options
-------------------------------

By default, prices are updated automatically on the product display page.  You can disable this by:
      Spree::Config.set :use_javascript_pricing_updates => false
(NOT in your activate method!  I tried this and the preferences subsystem hadn't been 'initialized' yet.

This option controls whether or not the 'products/pricing' partial is included.

This example below does not yet work, as exclusions aren't yet enabled for multi-select ad hoc options

### Another Ad Hoc Options Example (using exclusions) NOT WORKING

Let's create a pizza product.  There are several possible approaches.

Imagine numerous toppings options (pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms, ham, pineapple).

Imagine also that each topping could be priced differently (e.g. pepperoni is $2, mushrooms are $1.25, etc.).

Additionally, toppings cost more for larger sized pizzas.

We are going to use exclusions to control which options are allowed to coexist.

Note that this extension could have used (and might do so in the future) a differnet approach for the "toppings cost is depending on another option (size)" issue, but for now, exclusions will solve this problem easily.

We are going to set up the following:

#### Options

       Size
Value             Pricing Adjustment
  S                  0
  M                 $2
  L                 $3

       Toppings
Value                   Pricing Adjustment
 small_pepperoni               $2
 medium_pepperoni              $3
 large_pepperoni               $4.50
 small_mushrooms               $1.25
 medium_mushrooms              $2
 large_mushrooms               $2.50
 small_onions                  $0.75
 medium_onions                 $1.00
 large_onions                  $1.25

Let's also say that the store owner hates it when people order vegetarian pizzas, so he forbids it.

Let's now use the admin app to create these ad-hoc options
